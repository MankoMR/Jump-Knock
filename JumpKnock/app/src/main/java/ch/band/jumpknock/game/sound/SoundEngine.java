     * being held, failure to call this method immediately if a
     * MediaPlayer object is no longer needed may also lead to
     * continuous battery consumption for mobile devices, and playback
     * failure for other applications if no multiple instances of the
     * same codec are supported on a device. Even if multiple instances
     * of the same codec are supported, some performance degradation
     * may be expected when unnecessary multiple instances are used
     * at the same time.
